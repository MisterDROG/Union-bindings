This site is made as a project for a portfolio. The site is dedicated to the Union Bindings company, which produces snowboard bindings. It demonstrates the work with the following technologies:

- HTML5 and CSS
- Flex layout
- Pseudo classes
- Working with semantics, images, lists, links
- Creating animations
- Working with the BEM structure

For the future, there are plans to work with adaptability and add feedback forms.
